      <h3>Blogging</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I wrote my first blog when I was in the 8th grade. I began with compiling all my poems , limericks as well as some messages in te form of thoughts.
            The theme of the blog was to tell my views about how I look towards life. The link to the same is as follows:-
          <a href="http://learnaboutlife1.blogspot.com/">learnaboutlife.blogspot.com</a> </li>
          <li>I started the second blog in the first year of my B Tech course. The purpose of the same was to provide knowledge regarding various fields ranging right from astronomy to history to art & design.
            As in I get deep into these topics, I document them and put it in there. The link for the blog is:-
<a href="https://theexplorerzone.blogspot.com/2021/03/exo-planets-are-we-humans-alone-in.html">theexplorerzone.blogspot.com</a>
